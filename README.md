## **Dataset Overview**

The dataset used in this project focuses on **musical track features** and **genres**, providing numerical and categorical attributes. Below is a summary of the dataset:

- **Attributes:**  
  - **Danceability:** A float value describing how suitable the track is for dancing.
  - **Energy:** A measure of intensity and activity within the song.
  - **Loudness:** The overall loudness of the track in decibels.
  - **Speechiness:** The presence of spoken words in the track.
  - **Acousticness:** Likelihood that the track is acoustic.
  - **Instrumentalness:** Describes how much of the track is purely instrumental.
  - **Tempo:** Beats per minute (BPM) of the track.
  - **Valence:** A measure of musical positivity or happiness.
  - **Genres:** Categorical labels representing the type of music (e.g., Trap, EDM, Hardstyle).

- **Dataset Size:**  
  - **Rows:** 42,305
  - **Columns:** 28 (after preprocessing)
  
This dataset allows for deep exploration of **musical patterns, genre classification, and data preparation workflows** using various AutoML models.

## **Colab Notebook Overview**

The Colab notebook demonstrates an **end-to-end workflow** for preparing the dataset, performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and building **machine learning models** using **AutoML techniques**. 

### **Steps Covered in the Colab:**

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Loaded the **final preprocessed dataset**.
   - Ensured **feature scaling** using **StandardScaler**.
   - Removed **outliers** and ensured high-quality data for model building.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization:**
   - Conducted **distribution analysis** on numerical features (e.g., danceability, energy).
   - Created a **correlation heatmap** to identify feature relationships.
   - Visualized **top genres** with bar plots to understand data distribution.

3. **AutoML Model Building with AutoVIML:**
   - **Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning** were automated using **AutoVIML**.
   - Built multiple models and selected the **best-performing ensemble model**.
   - Achieved an outstanding **accuracy score of 99%** on the test set.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using **accuracy metrics**.
   - Addressed potential **feature mismatches** to ensure smooth predictions on the test set.
